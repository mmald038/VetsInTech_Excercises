# ITP Week 3 Day 2 Exercise

# import in the two modules for making API calls and parsing the data  

import json 

import requests
# set a url variable to "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character"

url = "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character"

# set a variable response to the "get" request of the url

response = requests.get(url)

# print to verify we have a status code of 200

print(response)

# assign a variable json_data to the responses' json

json_data = response.json()

# print to verify a crazy body of strings!

print(json_data)


print(type(json_data))     #confirming the type

# lets make it into a python dictionary by using the appropriate json method

dict_data = json.loads(response.text)       # After parsing the JSON string, it will store the equivalent Python object. Since json_data is already a dictionary, I decided to use response.text to complete the exercise
    # dict_data = response.json()           # This will also return a dictionary

# print the newly created python object

print(dict_data)

# confirming that it is a dictionary

print(type(dict_data))
